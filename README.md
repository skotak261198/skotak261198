## Hi there, I'm Shamit Kotak! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about turning data into actionable insights that drive business growth and innovation. With a strong technical foundation in Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, I combine analytical expertise with strategic thinking to solve complex problems and optimize processes.

## About Me.

I am Shamit Kotak, a data-driven professional currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunications from KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology in Mumbai, India.

My professional journey began as a Data Engineering Analyst at Accenture in Mumbai, where I honed my skills in data processing, ETL frameworks, and workflow automation. At the University of Maryland, I have contributed as a Research Assistant in the TTAPS Initiative. I lead a team to evaluate the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various sectors, including healthcare, hospitality, and education. Furthermore, I'm even serving as a graduate assistant at the Office of Faculty Affairs and as a project coordinator for the NextGen PM committee, managing several events across the university to support faculty development. I assist in administrative tasks such as creating events, workshops, and other faculty-related events. I make sure that deadlines are met while maintaining clear and proactive communication with stakeholders across campus.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered solutions that enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and provide valuable insights for stakeholders. I am always eager to explore new challenges and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of data science and analytics.
